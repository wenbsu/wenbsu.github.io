Hey everyone! I'm wenbsu, Welcome to my personal website. I am a coder with a passion for both coding and running marathons. Here, I will share my technical insights, running experiences, and reflections on my career path.

**About Me**  
I am a programmer deeply rooted in the world of code, fueled by a passion for technology and a relentless curiosity. With several years in the IT industry, I have witnessed the rapid evolution of technology, constantly learning and adapting. However, facing age bias in the industry has led to feelings of anxiety and uncertainty about my future career path.

**Hobbies and Persistence**  
Beyond coding, I have another exhilarating passion—running. As a fervent marathon participant, each step on the racecourse brings not just a challenge but a breakthrough of personal limits. Marathons have taught me perseverance, resilience, and a spirit of self-transcendence—qualities equally vital in coding and professional life.

**Career Anxiety and the Unknown Path Ahead**  
Despite my love for coding, age bias in the IT industry has become a significant obstacle. Recognizing this as a widespread issue, I've decided to share my experiences and reflections on this platform, hoping to connect with like-minded individuals. Whether you are a newcomer or an industry veteran, we all face similar challenges. Let's confront them together and explore the unknown path ahead.

**English Learning and Expanding Horizons**  
To better adapt to industry changes, I've recently embarked on learning English. As a universally recognized language, English is crucial for collaborating with developers worldwide and staying updated on the latest tech trends. I believe that by mastering English, I'll broaden my exposure to advanced technologies and ideas, unlocking more possibilities for my professional development.

**Mission of the Blog**  
Through this blog, I aim to document my technical growth, marathon journeys, and career exploration. Simultaneously, I want to connect with more friends, sharing experiences and insights. Whether you are a tech enthusiast, a running aficionado, or someone navigating career uncertainties, this is a place to resonate and find support.
In this era of constant change, let's run together, challenge ourselves, and explore the marathon life behind the code.
