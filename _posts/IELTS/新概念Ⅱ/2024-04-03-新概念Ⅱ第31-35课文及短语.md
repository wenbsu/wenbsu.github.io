## Lesson31 Success story 成功者的故事
**What was Frank's first job?**

Yesterday afternoon Frank Hawkins was telling me about his experiences as a young man.    
Before he retired, Frank was the head of a very large business company, but as a boy he used to work in a small shop.    
It was his job to repair bicycles and at that time he used to work fourteen hours a day.    
He saved money for years and in 1958  he bought a small workshop of his own.    
In his twenties Frank used to make spare parts for aeroplanes.    
At that time he had two helpers.    
In a few years the small workshop had become a large factory which employed seven hundred and twenty-eight people.   
Frank smiled when he remembered his hard early years and the long road to success.    
He was still smiling when the door opened and his wife came in.    
She wanted him to repair their grandson's bicycle!

昨天下午弗兰克·霍金斯向我讲述了他年轻时的经历。
在退休前，弗兰克是一家非常大的商业公司的经理，
但他小时候却在一家小铺里做工。
他那时的工作是修理自行车，并且通常是一天工作14个小时。
他靠多年积蓄，于1958年买下了自己的一个小铺子。
20多岁的时候，弗兰克曾生产飞机零配件。那时他有两个帮手。
几年之后，小铺子已经发展成了一个雇有728人的大工厂。
弗兰克回想着他早年的艰难经历和走过的漫长的成功之路，微笑了。
他正笑着的时候门开了，他的妻子走了进来。
她叫他去修理孙子的自行车。    

## Lesson32 Shopping made easy 购物变得很方便
**Who was the thief?**

People are not so honest as they once were.       
The temptation to steal is greater than ever before----especially in large shops.       
A detective recently watched a well-dressed woman       
who always went into a large store on Monday mornings.       
One Monday, there were fewer people in the shop than usual when the woman came in,       
So it was easier for the detective to watch her.       
The woman first bought a few small articles.       
After a little time, she chose one of the most expensive dresses in the shop       
and handed it to an assistant who wrapped it up for her as quickly as possible.       
Then the woman simply took the parcel and walked out of the shop without paying.    
When she was arrested, the detective found out that the shop assistant was her daughter.    
The girl ‘gave’ her mother a free dress once a week!       

**New words and expressions 生词和短语**  

1. once(1.1) adv.曾经，以前          
2. wrap(1.8)/ræp/ v.包裹
3. temptation(1.1)/temp'teiʃən/ n.诱惑      
4. simply(1.9)/'simpli/ adv.仅仅
5. article(1.7)/'ɑ:təkəl/ n.物品，东西    
6. arrest(1.10)/ə'rest/ v.逮捕

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. People are not so honest as they once were.人们不再像以前那样诚实了。其中的句型“not so +形容词+as…”是比较状语从句，可以译成“不如……那样……”。
2. The temptation to steal is greater than ever before.偷窃的诱惑力比以往任何时候更强烈。to steal是动词不定式，用来作temptation的定语。
3. well-dressed，穿着入时的，这是复合形容词。
4. than usual，比平常。
5. so it was easier for the detective to watch her，因此，侦探比较容易监视她。在这句话中，it只是一个先行词，实际主语是后面的不定式短语for the detective to watch her。
6. wrap up，包起来。
7. as…as possible，尽可能……。
8. without paying，没有付款，这里用介词短语作状语，表示方式；其中的动名词paying作介词without的宾语。

**参考译文**

人们不再像以前那样诚实了。
偷窃的诱惑力比以往任何时候都更强烈——特别是在大的商店里。
一名侦探最近注意上了一位穿着讲究的妇女，
她总是在星期一上午进入一家大商场。
有一个星期一，当这位妇女走进这家商场时，
里面的人比往常少，因此，侦探比较容易监视她。
这位妇女先是买了几样小商品。
过了一会几，她又选了商场里最昂贵的一件衣服，
把它递给了售货员。那售货员以最快的速度为她包好了衣服。
然后，那妇女拿过包就走出了商场，根本没有付钱。
她被逮捕后，侦探发现原来那售货员是她的女儿。
那姑娘每星期“送”她母亲一件免费的衣服！   


## Lesson33 Out of the darkness 冲出黑暗
**Why was the girl in hospital?**

Nearly a week passed before the girl was able to explain what had happened to her.    
One afternoon she set out from the coast in a small boat and was caught in a storm.    
Towards evening, the boat struck a rock and the girl jumped into the sea.    
Then she swam to the shore after spending the whole night in the water.    
During that time she covered a distance of eight miles.    
Early next morning, she saw a light ahead.    
She knew she was near the shore because the light was high up on the cliffs.    
On arriving at the shore, the girl struggled up the cliff towards the light she had seen.    
That was all she remembered.   
When she woke up a day later, she found herself in hospital.    

**New words and expressions 生词和短语**  

1. darkness(title)/'da:knəs/n.黑暗
2. shore(1.4)/ʃɔ::/n.海岸
3. explain(1.1)/iks'plein/v. 解释，叙述
4. light(1.7)/lait/n. 灯光
5. coast(1.2)/'kəust/n.海岸
6. ahead(1.7)/ə'hed/adv. 在前面
7. storm(1.3)/stɔ:m/n.暴风雨

10. struggle(1.8)/'strʌgəl/v.挣扎
11. rock(1.4)/rɔk/n.岩石，礁石
12. hospital(1.10)／'hɔspitl/n. 医院


**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. set out，出发，动身。
2. …was caught in a storm，遇上了暴风雨。catch此处作“突然遇上”讲。
3. During that time she covered a distance of eight miles. 在那段时间里，她游了8英里。cover作“行过”、“走过”、“游过”等讲。
4. a light ahead，前面的一盏灯。 ahead是形容词，此处作定语，放在所修饰的名词的后面。
5. On arriving at the shore…，一到岸边……。on +动名词相当于一个由as soon as引导的时间状语从句。
6. That was all she remembered. 她所记得的就是这些。all是句中的表语，she remembered是定语从句，用来修饰all，引导词that因在从句中作宾语而被省略。

**参考译文**

几乎过了一个星期，那姑娘才能讲述自己的遭遇。
一天下午，她乘小船从海岸出发，遇上了风暴。
天将黑时，小船撞在了一块礁石上，姑娘跳进了海里。
她在海里游了整整一夜才游到岸边。在那段时间里，她游了8英里。
第二天凌晨，她看到前方有灯光，知道自己已经接近岸边了，因为那灯光是在高高的峭壁上。
到达岸边后，姑娘朝着她看到的灯光方向挣扎着往峭壁上爬去。
她所记得的就是这些。第二天她醒来时，发现自己躺在医院里。   


## Lesson34 Quick work 破案“神速”
**How long had the police taken to find his bicycle?**

Dan Robinson has been worried all week.   
Last Tuesday he received a letter from the local police.   
In the letter he was asked to call at the station.    
Dan wondered why he was wanted by the police,   
but he went to the station yesterday and now he is not worried anymore.   
At the station, he was told by a smiling policeman    
that his bicycle had been found.    
Five days ago, the policeman told him,    
the bicycle was picked up in a small village four hundred miles away.       
It is now being sent to his home by train.    
Dan was most surprised when he heard the news.    
He was amused too, because he never expected the bicycle to be found,    
It was stolen twenty years ago when Dan was a boy of fifteen!    

**New words and expressions 生词和短语**  

1. station(1.3)/'stiʃən/n.(警察)局 
2. most(1.8)/məust/adv. 相当，非常

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. the local police，当地警察(局)。
2. call at，拜访，也可用call on。
3. he is not worried anymore，他不再担心了。
4. the policeman told him，警察告诉他。这是插入成分，在讲故事时常用这种方式。
5. the bicycle was picked up in a small village four hundred miles away，那辆自行车在400英里以外的一个小村里被发现。pick up有“意外地找到”的意思。
6. It is now being sent to his home by train. 现在正用火车给他运回家来。当被动语态用于现在进行时中，要在助动词be后面加上-ing，再加上过去分词。
7. most surprised中的most有very的意思，常常与起形容词作用的过去分词连用。

**参考译文**

丹·鲁宾逊焦虑了整整一个星期。
上星期二他收到当地警察局的一封信，要他到警察局去一趟。
丹奇怪警察为什么找他，但昨天还是去了，结果他不再担心了。
在警察局里，一位面带笑容的警察告诉他，他的自行车找到了。
那位警察对他说，那辆自行车是5天前在400英里外的一个小村里发现的，
现在正用火车给他运回家来。
丹听到这个消息后，惊奇万分，但又感到非常好笑，
因为他从未指望那辆自行车还能找到。
这是20年前丹还是一个15岁的孩子时被人偷走的！   


## Lesson35 Stop thief!捉贼！
**How did Roy stop the thieves?**

Roy Trenton used to drive a taxi.   
A short while ago, however,    
he became a bus driver and he has not regretted it.    
He is finding his new work far more exciting.   
When he was driving along Catford Street recently,    
he saw two thieves rush out of a shop and run towards a waiting car.    
One of them was carrying a bag full of money.    
Roy acted quickly and drove the bus straight at the thieves.    
The one with the money got such a fright that he dropped the bag.    
As the thieves were trying to get away in their car,   
Roy drove his bus into the back of it.   
While the battered car was moving away,    
Roy stopped his bus and telephoned the police.   
The thieves' car was badly damaged and easy to recognize.    
Shortly afterwards, the police stopped the car and both men were arrested.   

**New words and expressions 生词和短语**  

1. while (1.1) /wail/ n. 一段时间
2. straight (1.6) /streit/ adv. 径直
3. regret (1.2) /ri'gret/ v. 后悔
4. fright (1.7) /frait/ n. 害怕
5. far (1.3) /fa:/ adv. 非常

9. act (1.6) /ækt/ v. 行动
10. afterwards (1.10) /a:ftəwədz/ adv. 以后

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. a short while ago, 不久前。
2. far more exciting, 令人兴奋得多。far是副词，放在比较级的形容词前，表示程度，可译作“很”、“大大地”。
3. he saw two thieves rush out of a shop and run towards a waiting car, 他看到两个小偷从一家商店里冲出来，奔向等在那里的一辆汽车。在动词see后面接不定式时，不定式要省去to，如本句中的rush和run两个不定式。
4. a bag full of money, 一只装满钞票的提包。full of…是形容词短语，此处作定语，相当于一个定语从句which was full of money。
5. The one with the money got such a fright that he dropped the bag. 拿钱的那个小偷吓得把提包都扔了。句中such…that…的结构有“如此……以至于……”的意思，such后面要跟名词。
6. shortly afterwards, 没过多久。

**参考译文**

罗伊·特雷顿原是开出租汽车的，然而就在前不久，
他开上了公共汽车，也并不为此而感到后悔。
他发觉自己的新工作令人兴奋得多。
最近，当他正开车在凯特福德街上行驶时，
看到有两个小偷从一家商店里冲出来，奔向等在那里的一辆汽车，
其中一个提着一只装满钞票的提包。
罗伊行动迅速，开车直冲窃贼而去。
拿钱的那个小偷吓得把提包都扔了。
当那两个小偷企图乘车逃跑时，罗伊驾驶他的公共汽车撞在了那辆车的后尾上。
当那辆被撞坏的车开走后，罗伊停下车，给警察挂了电话。
小偷的车损坏严重，很容易辨认。
没过多久，警察就截住了那辆车，两个小偷都被抓住了。
