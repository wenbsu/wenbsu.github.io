## Lesson81 Escape 逃脱
**Why did the prisoner attack the driver?**

When he had killed the guard, the prisoner of war quickly dragged him into the bushes.    
Working rapidly in the darkness, he soon changed into the dead man's clothes.    
Now, dressed in a blue uniform and with a rifle over his shoulder,    
he marched boldly up and down in front of the camp.    
He could hear shouting in the camp itself.    
Lights were blazing and men were running here and there:    
they had just discovered that a prisoner had escaped.    
At that moment, a large black car with four officers inside it,    
stopped at the camp gates.    
The officers got out and the prisoner stood to attention and saluted as they passed.    
When they had gone, he quickly jumped into the car    
and drove off into the darkness.    
The car had hardly gone half a mile when it ran out of petrol.    
The prisoner got out and began to walk away from the camp.    
Though he still wore a blue uniform, he was forced to hide in the bushes whenever a car passed.    
At last, he found an empty barn about two miles away from the camp.    
There he stayed until the following morning.

他在黑暗中麻利地换上了死者的衣服。
现在，他身穿蓝色军装，肩扛步枪，
在军营门前大胆地来回走着。
他听得见营房里的喊叫声。
灯火通明，人们在这里那里奔跌：
他们刚刚发现有一个俘虏跑了。
正在此时，一辆黑色大轿车在军营门口停了下来，
车内坐着4个军官。
军官们下了车，那个俘虏立正站好，向他们敬礼。
他们走后，他迅速跳进轿车，
驶入了黑暗之中。
轿车还没开出半英里就没油了。
那个俘虏下了车，步行离开军营。
尽管他仍穿着蓝色军装，但每当有车经过时，他还是被迫躲进灌木丛。
最后，他在离军营约2英里的地方找到了一个空谷仓。
他就在那里待到第二天早晨。

## Lesson82 Monster or fish? 是妖还是鱼？
**What was the monster called?**

Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have seen monsters in the sea.    
Though people have often laughed at stories told by seamen,    
there is no doubt that many strange creatures live in the depths of the oceans.    
Many years ago, a peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar.    
It was five feet long and had a head like a horse.    
The fish was examined by a scientist who named it 'sea-cow'.    
For a long time, no one believed the scientist's story.    
Then, in 1938, a similar fish was caught off the South African coast.    
It was called 'coelacanth' and the discovery of this strange creature    
caused a great deal of interest.    
The coelacanth (pronounced 'seel-a-kanth') was a member of a family of fish    
which were supposed to have died out seventy million years ago.    
Since then, several others have been caught.    
The coelacanth is dark brown in colour and has fins which look like legs.    
It is five feet long and weighs a hundred pounds.    
Scientists think that this fish can tell us a great deal about the period    
when seamen first began to walk on land.

**参考译文**

渔民和水手有时声称自己看见过海里的妖怪。
虽然人们经常对水手讲的故事付之一笑，
但毫无疑问，在海洋深处确实住着许多奇怪的生物。
许多年以前，在马达加斯加附近捕到一条奇怪的鱼。
它有5英尺长，长着一个像马一样的脑袋。
一位科学家检查了这条鱼，把它命名为"海牛"。
很长时间以来，谁也不相信科学家的话。
后来，在1938年，在南非海岸又捕获一条相似的鱼。
这条鱼被称作"腔棘鱼"，这种奇怪生物的发现
引起了极大的兴趣。
腔棘鱼（读作'seel-a-kanth'）属于一科鱼类，
这种鱼被认为已在7,000万年前就绝种了。
从那以后，又捕到了几条。
腔棘鱼呈深褐色，长有像腿一样的鳍。
它有5英尺长，重达100英镑。
科学家认为这种鱼能告诉我们许多有关海洋生物
开始在陆地上行走时期的情况。

## Lesson83 After the elections 大选之后
**Why did Patrick keep on asking the same question?**

The former Prime Minister, Mr. Wentworth Lane, was defeated in the recent elections.    
He had served as Prime Minister for eighteen years    
and his long term of office had at last come to an end.    
He looked much older than his sixty-five years    
and his friends feared that he would retire from political life.    
But Mr. Lane was still a Member of Parliament.    
Though he was leader of the Opposition,    
he still had an important part to play in politics.    
Mr. Lane was holding his first political meeting since his defeat.    
The hall was packed with people    
who were eager to hear what he had to say.    
They were not disappointed.    
In a violent attack on the new government,    
Mr. Lane spoke of the mistakes that had been made in home and foreign policy.    
The audience cheered wildly when he said that the party would return to power.    
'We can look forward to the future with confidence,' he said.    
Patrick Lane, the former Prime Minister's small grandson,    
was in the audience.    
Towards the end of this speech, he suddenly stood up and shouted,    
'Granddad, when will you be Prime Minister again?'    
The audience roared with laughter    
and Mr. Lane forgot what he was going to say.    
With tears in his eyes, he left the platform.    
In spite of this, he smiled and waved to the crowd.    
Then he returned to his seat and Patrick ran towards him.    
Mr. Lane picked him up and hugged him.    
'I don't know, my boy,' he said.    
'I don't know.'

前首相温特沃思.莱恩先生在最近的大选中被击败。
他曾任首相18年之久，
他的长期任职现已最终结束。
他看上去比他的65岁实际年龄要老得多，
他的朋友们唯恐他会从政治舞台上退下来。
但是，莱恩先生仍然是一名议员。
虽然他成了反对党的领袖，
但他在政治中仍然要发挥重要作用。
这是莱恩先生在落选后举行的第一次政治集会。
大厅里挤满了人，
人们急于听他讲话。
他们并未失望。
在对新政府的猛烈抨击中，
莱恩先生谈到了内政与外交政策方面所犯的错误。
当他说他的政党将重新上台时，听众欣喜若狂地欢呼起来。
"我们对未来充满信心，"他说。
帕特里克.莱恩，前首相的小孙子，
也在听众之中。
在讲话快要结束时，他突然站起来大声说：
"爷爷，您什么时候再当首相？"
听众轰然大笑，
莱恩先生忘记了下面要讲的话。
他眼含泪水，离开了讲台。
尽管如此，他还是笑着向人群挥手致意。
然后他回到座位上，帕特里克朝他跑过来。
莱恩先生把他抱起来，紧紧搂住他。
"我不知道，孩子，"他说，
"我不知道。"

## Lesson84 On strike 罢工
**Why did the workers go on strike?**

The big clock in the station showed that it was eight o'clock.    
Everyone was waiting for the train.    
The train was late and no one knew why.    
'I expect that the train drivers are on strike again,' a passenger said.    
'They are always going on strike nowadays.'    
Most of the people at the station worked in London    
and many of them travelled to the city every day.    
They had season tickets and they were becoming increasingly angry.    
Though the train was forty minutes late,    
none of them left the station.    
'I shall be late for work again,' a man said angrily.    
'My boss won't believe me when I tell him that the train was late.'    
'It's the same old story,' another passenger said.    
'The trains are always late in winter.'    
Just then, they heard a noise in the distance.    
'Perhaps that's our train,' a woman said hopefully.    
'No, that's the bus,' someone said.    
'The bus is full.    
It won't stop here.'    
Sure enough, the bus did not stop at the station.    
Everyone at the station became more and more angry.    
Suddenly, they saw a man running towards them.    
'There isn't going to be a train,' he shouted.    
'The train drivers are on strike.    
They are demanding higher pay.    
We'll have to wait for the next bus.'

人们都在等车。
火车晚点了，谁也不知道是怎么回事。
"我看大概是火车司机又罢工了，"一位乘客说。
"现在他们总是罢工。"
车站上的大多数人都在伦敦工作，
他们中许多人天天都去城里。
他们都持有季票，他们的怒气越来越大了。
尽管火车晚了40分钟，
他们谁也没离开车站。
"我上班又要迟到了，"一个人生气地说。
"我告诉老板火车晚点了，他也不会相信的。"
"这是老一套了，"另一位乘客说。
"冬天火车总是晚点。"
正在这时，他们听到远处传来了响声。
"也许那是我们的车，"一位妇女满怀希望地说。
"不，那是公共汽车，"一个人说。
"车已经满了，
不会在这儿停的。"
果然，公共汽车没有在车站停。
车站里的人们越来越生气了。
突然，他们看见一个人朝他们跑来。
"不会再有火车了，"他喊道。
"司机罢工了。
他们要求提高工资。
我们只得等下一辆公共汽车了。"

## Lesson85 Never too old to learn 活到老学到老
**What was the old lady's reaction to the bicycle?**

I have just received a letter from my old friend, Jenny.    
She has always been very fond of bikes,    
but now she has written to tell me that she has bought herself a motorcycle.    
She has already begun to have lessons.    
Jenny lives in the country and has always used a bicycle to get about.    
Last year, however, she had a bad fall and injured her leg.    
She has now realized that she can no longer ride a bicycle,    
for she will never be able to use her left leg again.    
Jenny has always been an active person,    
so she found it very difficult to remain at home.    
She hates having to depend on other people to do things for her.    
She has a married daughter who often visits her,    
but she lives in a town which is ten miles away.    
The motorcycle has already made a big difference to Jenny's life.    
She can now go to town as often as she likes.    
She can even go for quite long distances on the motorcycle.    
It is wonderful to think that a person of her age can be so enthusiastic.    
Jenny's seventieth birthday is next month,    
but she does not want to be reminded of this.    
She knows that she will have to stop riding one day,    
but she says that she will continue to go for rides on her motorcycle    
as long as she is able to.

我刚刚收到老朋友珍妮的一封信。
她一直都很喜欢自行车，
但是现在她写信告诉我她给自己买了一辆摩托车。
她已经开始上驾驶课了。
珍妮住在乡下，一直骑自行车四处活动。
然而，去年她摔得很重，摔伤了腿。
她现在意识到她再也不能骑自行车了，
因为她的左腿再也不能使用了。
珍妮一直是个活跃的人，
因此，让她留在家里是很困难的。
她讨厌依赖别人为她做事。
她有个已婚的女儿经常来看她，
但是她住在10英里外的一个城镇里。
摩托车已经给珍妮的生活带来了很大的变化。
她现在可以随意地进城了。
她甚至可以骑摩托车走很远的路。
想想一个她这样年龄的人还这样有热情，真是令人惊奇。
珍妮下个月就70岁生日了，
但她不愿别人提起这事。
她知道总有一天要停止骑车，
但她说只要她还能骑，
她就要继续骑她的摩托车。
