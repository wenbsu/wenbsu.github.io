## Lesson81 Escape 逃脱
**Why did the prisoner attack the driver?**

When he had killed the guard, the prisoner of war quickly dragged him into the bushes.    
Working rapidly in the darkness, he soon changed into the dead man's clothes.    
Now, dressed in a blue uniform and with a rifle over his shoulder,    
he marched boldly up and down in front of the camp.    
He could hear shouting in the camp itself.    
Lights were blazing and men were running here and there:    
they had just discovered that a prisoner had escaped.    
At that moment, a large black car with four officers inside it,    
stopped at the camp gates.    
The officers got out and the prisoner stood to attention and saluted as they passed.    
When they had gone, he quickly jumped into the car    
and drove off into the darkness.    
The car had hardly gone half a mile when it ran out of petrol.    
The prisoner got out and began to walk away from the camp.    
Though he still wore a blue uniform, he was forced to hide in the bushes whenever a car passed.    
At last, he found an empty barn about two miles away from the camp.    
There he stayed until the following morning.

## Lesson82 Monster or fish? 是妖还是鱼？
**What was the monster called?**

Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have seen monsters in the sea.    
Though people have often laughed at stories told by seamen,    
there is no doubt that many strange creatures live in the depths of the oceans.    
Many years ago, a peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar.    
A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line.    
Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every effort not to damage it in any way.    
When it was eventually brought to shore, it was found to be over thirteen feet long.    
It had a head like a horse, big blue eyes, and shining silver skin.    
The fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is being examined by a scientist,    
is called an oarfish.    
Such creatures have rarely been seen alive by man as they live at a depth of six hundred feet.

渔民和水手有时声称自己看见过海里的妖怪。虽然人们经常对水手讲的故事付之一笑，但毫无疑问，在海洋深处确实住着许多奇怪的生物。许多年以前，在马达加斯加附近捕到一条奇怪的鱼。它有5英尺长，长着一个像马一样的脑袋。一位科学家检查了这条鱼，把它命名为"海牛"。很长时间以来，谁也不相信科学家的话。后来，在1938年，在南非海岸又捕获一条相似的鱼。这条鱼被称作"腔棘鱼"，这种奇怪生物的发现引起了极大的兴趣。腔棘鱼（读作'seel-a-kanth'）属于一科鱼类，这种鱼被认为已在7,000万年前就绝种了。从那以后，又捕到了几条。腔棘鱼呈深褐色，长有像腿一样的鳍。它有5英尺长，重达100英镑。科学家认为这种鱼能告诉我们许多有关海洋生物开始在陆地上行走时期的情况。

## Lesson83 After the elections 大选之后
**Why did Patrick keep on asking the same question?**

The former Prime Minister, Mr. Wentworth Lane, was defeated in the recent elections.    
He is now retiring from political life and has gone abroad.    
My friend, Patrick, has always been a fanatical opponent of Mr. Lane's Radical Progressive Party.    
After the elections, Patrick went to the former Prime Minister's house.    
When he asked if Mr. Lane lived there, the policeman on duty told him that since his defeat, the ex-Prime Minister had gone abroad.    
On the following day, Patrick went to the house again.    
The same policeman was just walking slowly past the entrance, when Patrick asked the same question.    
Though a little suspicious this time, the policeman gave him the same answer.    
The day after, Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly the same question.    
This time, the policeman lost his temper.    
"I told you yesterday and the day before yesterday," he shouted.    
"Mr. Lane was defeated in the elections. He has retired from political life and gone to live abroad!"    
"I know," answered Patrick, "but I love to hear you say it!"

## Lesson84 On strike 罢工
**Why did the workers go on strike?**

Busmen have decided to go on strike next week. The strike is due to begin on Tuesday. No one knows how long it will last. The busmen have stated that the strike will continue until general agreement is reached about pay and working conditions. Most people believe that the strike will last for at least a week. Many owners of private cars are going to offer 'free rides' to people on their way to work. This will relieve pressure on the trains to some extent. Meanwhile, a number of university students have volunteered to drive buses while the strike lasts. All the students are expert drivers, but before they drive any of the buses, they will have to pass a special test. The students are going to take the test in two days' time. Even so, people are going to find it difficult to get to work. But so far, the public has expressed its gratitude to the students in letters to the Press. Only one or two people have objected that the students will drive too fast!

公交车司机决定下周罢工。罢工定于星期二开始。没有人知道这次罢工将持续多久。公交车司机表示，罢工将持续到达成关于工资和工作条件的普遍协议。大多数人认为罢工将持续至少一周。许多私家车主将会在上班途中为人们提供"免费搭乘"。这将会在一定程度上缓解火车的压力。与此同时，一些大学生自愿在罢工期间驾驶公交车。所有的学生都是经验丰富的司机，但在驾驶任何公交车之前，他们必须通过一个特殊的测试。学生们将在两天后进行测试。尽管如此，人们仍然会发现上班很困难。但到目前为止，公众对学生们在报纸上的感谢信表示了感激。只有一两个人反对学生们会开得太快！

## Lesson85 Never too old to learn 活到老学到老
**How long has Mr. Page been teaching?**

I have just received a letter from my old school, informing me that my former headmaster, Mr. Stuart Page, will be retiring next week. Pupils of the school, old and new, will be sending him a present to mark the occasion. All those who have contributed towards the gift will sign their names in a large album which will be sent to the headmaster's home. We shall all remember Mr. Page for his patience and understanding and for the kindly encouragement he gave us when we went so unwillingly to school. A great many former pupils will be attending a farewell dinner in his honour next Thursday. It is a curious coincidence that the day before his retirement, Mr. Page will have been teaching for a total of forty years. After he has retired, he will devote himself to gardening. For him, this will be an entirely new hobby. But this does not matter, for, as he has often remarked, one is never too old to learn.

我刚刚收到老学校的一封信，通知我前校长斯图尔特·佩奇先生将于下周退休。学校的老生和新生将会送他一份礼物以示庆祝。所有为这份礼物贡献的人都将在一个大相册上签名，送到校长的家里。我们都将铭记佩奇先生的耐心和理解，以及他在我们不情愿上学时给予的鼓励。许多前学生将参加下周四为他举行的告别晚宴。巧合的是，在他退休的前一天，佩奇先生将已经教书整整四十年。退休后，他将致力于园艺。对他来说，这将是一个全新的爱好。但这并不重要，因为他常常说，活到老学到老。
