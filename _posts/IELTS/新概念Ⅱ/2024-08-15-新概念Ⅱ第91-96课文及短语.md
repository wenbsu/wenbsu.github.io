## Lesson91 Three men in a basket 三人同篮
**Why did the pilot of the balloon send the message 'HELP'?**

A pilot noticed a balloon which seemed to be making for a Royal Air Force Station nearby.    
He informed the station at once,    
but no one there was able to explain the mystery.    
The officer in the control tower was very angry when he heard the news,    
because balloons can be a great danger to aircraft.    
He said that someone might be spying on the station    
and the pilot was ordered to keep track of the strange object.    
The pilot managed to circle round the balloon for some time.    
He could make out three men in a basket under it    
and one of them was holding field-glasses.    
When the balloon was over the station,    
the pilot saw one of the men taking photographs.    
Soon afterwards, the balloon began to descend    
and it landed near an airfield.    
The police were called in,    
but they could not arrest anyone,    
for the basket contained two Members of Parliament    
and the Commanding Officer of the station!    
As the Commanding Officer explained later,    
one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing!

一个飞行员注意到一个气球，它似乎正在飞向附近的一个皇家空军基地。
他立即把这个情况报告了该基地，
但那里的人没有一个能解释这个谜。
控制塔上的军官得知这个消息后，非常生气，
因为气球可能给飞机造成极大的危险。
他说可能有人正在对基地进行侦察，
因此命令那个飞行员跟踪那个奇怪的物体。
飞行员设法绕着气球飞了一阵。
他能够看清气球下面的篮子里有3个人，
其中一个人举着望远镜。
当气球飞临基地上空时，
飞行员看到有一个人在拍照。
不久，气球开始降落，
在一个停机坪附近着陆。
警察被召来了，
但他们却不能逮捕任何人，
因为篮子里是两名国会议员和基地的指挥官！
正如指挥官后来解释的那样，
基地的这半边不知道那半边在干什么！

## Lesson92 Asking for trouble 自找麻烦
**Why did the policeman ask the writer to come to the police station?**

It must have been about two in the morning when I returned home.    
I tried to wake up my wife by ringing the door-bell,    
but she was fast asleep,    
so I got a ladder from the shed in the garden,    
put it against the wall,    
and began climbing towards the bedroom window.    
I was almost there when a sarcastic voice below said,    
'I don't think the windows need cleaning at this time of the night.'    
I looked down and nearly fell off the ladder when I saw a policeman.    
I immediately regretted answering in the way I did,    
but I said,    
'I enjoy cleaning windows at night.'    
'So do I,'    
answered the policeman in the same tone.    
'Excuse my interrupting you.    
I hate to interrupt a man when he's busy working,    
but would you mind coming with me to the station?'    
'Well, I'd prefer to stay here,'    
I said.    
'You see, I've forgotten my key.'    
'Your what?'    
he called.    
'My key,'    
I shouted.    
Fortunately, the shouting woke up my wife who opened the window just as the policeman had started climbing towards me.

**参考译文**

我回到家时，一定是凌晨2点钟左右。
我按响了门铃，试图唤醒我的妻子，
但她睡得很熟。
于是，我从花园的小棚里搬来了一个梯子，
把它靠在墙上，
开始向卧室的窗口爬去。
快要爬到窗口时，下面一个人用讽刺的口吻说：
"我看不必在夜里这个时候擦窗子吧。"
我向下一看，差点儿从梯子上掉下来。
我立即后悔不该那样回答，
但我还是说：
"我喜欢在夜里擦窗子。"
"我也是的，"
警察用同样的语气回答说。
"请原谅我打断了你。
我不愿打断一个正在忙着干活的人，
但请你跟我到警察局去一趟好吗？"
"我宁愿留在这儿，"
我说。
"你瞧，我忘带钥匙了。"
"你的什么？"
他大声问。
"我的钥匙，"
我喊道。
幸运得很，这喊声惊醒了我的妻子。
就在警察开始向我爬上来时，她打开了窗子。

## Lesson93 A noble gift 崇高的礼物
**What was the 'noble gift'?**

One of the most famous monuments in the world,    
the Statue of Liberty,    
was presented to the United States of America in the nineteenth century    
by the people of France.    
The great statue,    
which was designed by the sculptor Auguste Bartholdi,    
took ten years to complete.    
The actual figure was made of copper    
supported by a metal framework which had been especially constructed by Eiffel.    
Before it could be transported to the United States,    
a site had to be found for it    
and a pedestal had to be built.    
The site chosen was an island at the entrance of New York Harbour.    
By 1884,    
a statue which was 151 feet tall had been erected in Paris.    
The following year,    
it was taken to pieces and sent to America.    
By the end of October 1886,    
the statue had been put together again    
and it was officially presented to the American people by Bartholdi.    
Ever since then,    
the great monument has been a symbol of liberty    
for the millions of people who have passed through New York Harbour    
to make their homes in America.

由艾菲尔特制的金属框架支撑着。

同时必须建造一个基座。
场地选在了纽约港入口处的一个岛上。
到1884年，
一座高度达151英尺的雕像在巴黎竖立起来了。
第二年，
它被拆成若干小块运到美国。
到1886年10月底，
雕像被重新组装起来，
由巴托尔迪正式赠送给美国人民。
从那时起，
这座伟大的纪念碑对通过纽约港进入美国定居的千百万人来说，
就一直是自由的象征。

## Lesson94 Future champions 未来的冠军
**Why did the instructor ask the children to swim out to him?**

Experiments have proved that children can be taught swimming at a very early age.    
At a special swimming pool in Los Angeles,    
children become expert at holding their breath under water    
even before they can walk.    
Babies of two months old do not appear to be reluctant to enter the water.    
It is not long before they are so accustomed to swimming    
that they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool.    
A game that is very popular with these young swimmers    
is the underwater tricycle race.    
Tricycles are lined up on the floor of the pool seven feet under water.    
The children compete against each other to reach the other end of the pool.    
Many pedal their tricycles,    
but most of them prefer to push or drag them.    
Some children can cover the whole length of the pool    
without coming up for breath even once.    
Whether they will ever become future Olympic champions,    
only time will tell.    
Meanwhile,    
they should encourage those among us who cannot swim five yards    
before they are gasping for air.

7. tricycle(1.7)/ˈtraɪsɪkl/n.三轮脚踏车

9. pedal(1.10)/ˈpedl/v.骑脚踏车
10. gasp(1.15)/ɡɑːsp/v.喘气

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. be accustomed to,习惯于。
2. pick up,捡起。
3. compete against,与……竞争。
4. gasp for air,喘气。

**参考译文**

实验证明，儿童在很小的时候就可以被教会游泳。
在洛杉矶的一个特制的游泳池里，
孩子们甚至在还没有学会走路时就已经能熟练地在水下屏住呼吸了。
两个月的婴儿并未显得不愿意入水。
他们很快便适应了游泳，
以致能捡起池底的物品。
这些幼小的游泳运动员非常喜爱的一种游戏是水下三轮车比赛。
三轮车并排放在7英尺深的游泳池底上。
孩子们比赛看谁先到达游泳池的另一端。
很多孩子用脚蹬车，
但大多数孩子更愿意推或是拉着三轮车。
有些孩子能够游完游泳池的全长而不用露出水面换气。
他们将来是否能成为奥林匹克的冠军，
这只能由时间来作出回答。
同时，
他们对我们中的那些游不了5码就已喘不过气来的人应该是种鼓舞。

## Lesson95 A fantasy 纯属虚构
**Why did the Ambassador of Escalopia return home?**

his wife got a shock.    
He looked pale and his clothes were in a frightful state.    
'What has happened?'    
she asked.    
'How did your clothes get into such a mess?'    
'A fire-extinguisher, my dear,'

'University students set the Embassy on fire this morning.'    
'Good heavens!'    
exclaimed his wife.    
'And where were you at the time?'    
'I was in my office as usual,'    
answered the Ambassador.    
'The fire broke out in the basement.    
I went down immediately, of course,    
and that fool, Horst,    
aimed a fire-extinguisher at me.    
He thought I was on fire.    
I must definitely get that fellow posted.'    
The Ambassador's wife went on asking questions,    
when she suddenly noticed a big hole in her husband's hat.    
'And how can you explain that?'    
she asked.    
'Oh, that,'    
said the Ambassador.    
'Someone fired a shot through my office window.    
Accurate, don't you think?    
Fortunately, I wasn't wearing it at the time.    
If I had been,    
I would not have been able to get home for lunch.'

我当然马上下去了，
那个傻瓜霍斯特把灭火器对准了我。
他认为是我着火了。
我一定要把那个家伙打发走。"

她突然注意到丈夫帽子上的一个大洞。
"你如何解释这个呢？"
她问。
"那个啊，"
大使说。
"有人向我办公室窗户开了一枪。
真够准的，是不是？
幸亏我当时没戴帽子。
如果真戴着它，
我现在就不能回家来吃午饭了。" 


## Lesson96 The dead return 亡灵返乡
**Why is the festival 'a moving spectacle'?**

A Festival for the Dead is held once a year in Japan.    
This festival is a cheerful occasion,    
for on this day,    
the dead are said to return to their homes    
and they are welcomed by the living.    
As they are expected to be hungry after their long journey,    
food is laid out for them.    
Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house    
to help the dead to find their way.    
All night long,    
people dance and sing.    
In the early morning,    
the food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into a river or into the sea    
as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it.    
In towns that are near the sea,    
the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before,    
are placed into the water when the festival is over.    
Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea    
guiding the dead on their return journey to the other world.    
This is a moving spectacle,    
for crowds of people stand on the shore watching the lanterns drifting away until they can be seen no more.

**参考译文**

日本每年过一次"亡灵节"。
这个节日是个欢乐的日子，
因为在这一天，
据说死去的人要回到他们的家里来，
活着的人则对他们表示欢迎。
因为预料到他们在经过长途旅行之后会感到饥饿，
所以为他们摆放好了食品。
特制的灯笼挂在各家的门外，
为的是帮助亡灵看清道路。
整个夜晚人们载歌载舞。
一大早，
人们便把为死者摆放的食品扔进河中或海里，
因为人们认为活着的人吃了这些东西是不吉利的。
在靠海的城镇中，
头天夜里挂在大街上的小灯笼在节后就放在了水里。
成千上万只灯笼慢慢漂向大海，
指引着亡灵返回另一个世界。
这是一个感人的场面，
成群的人们伫立在海岸上，
注视着灯笼远去，
直到再也看不见为止。
