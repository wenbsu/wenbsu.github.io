## Lesson66 Sweet as honey! 像蜜一样甜!
**What was 'sweet as honey' and why?**

In 1963 a Lancaster bomber crashed on Wallis Island,    
a remote place in the South Pacific, a long way west of Samoa.    
The plane wasn't too badly damaged, but over the years,    
the crash was forgotten and the wreck remained undisturbed.    
Then in 1989, twenty-six years after the crash,    
the plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial survey of the island.    
By this time, a Lancaster bomber in reasonable condition was rare and worth rescuing.   
The French authorities had the plane packaged and moved in parts back to France.    
Now a group of enthusiasts are going to have the plane restored.    
It has four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines,    
but the group will need to have only three of them rebuilt.    
Imagine their surprise and delight when they broke open the packing cases    
and found that the fourth engine was sweet as honey    
-- still in perfect condition.    
A colony of bees had turned the engine into a hive and it was totally preserved in beeswax!

**参考译文**

1963年，一架兰开斯特轰炸机在瓦立斯岛毁。
那是南太洋中一个很偏僻的小岛，位于萨摩亚群岛以西，
距离群岛还有很长一段距离。
飞机损坏的程度并不严重，
但是，多年来这起飞机失事已被遗忘，
飞机残骸也没受到破坏。
于是，到了1989年，飞机失事26年后，
在对小岛的一次航空勘查中那架飞机被意外地发现了。
到了那个时候，状况良好的兰开斯特轰炸机实属罕见，值得抢救。
法国政府让人把飞机包装起来，一部分一部分地搬回法国。
一群热心人计划修复这架飞机。
该飞机装装配有4台罗尔斯-罗伊斯的默林发动机，
但是他们只需要修复其中的3台。
想一想他们所感受到的惊奇和兴奋 
—— 当他们拆开包装箱时，他们发现第4台发动机就像蜂蜜一样甜 
—— 发动机完好无损。
一群蜜蜂把发动机当作了蜂房，
发动机在蜂蜡中被完整地保存了下来。         


## Lesson67 Volcanoes 火山
**Why does Tazieff risk his life like this?**

Haroun Tazieff, the Polish scientist, has spent his lifetime studying active volcanoes      
and deep caves in all parts of the world.    
In 1948, he went to Lake Kivu in the Congo to observe a new volcano which he later named Kituro.    
Tazieff was able to set up his camp very close to the volcano while it was erupting violently.   
Though he managed to take a number of brilliant photographs,   
he could not stay near the volcano for very long.   
He noticed that a river of liquid rock was coming towards him.    
It threatened to surround him completely,    
but Tazieff managed to escape just in time.   
He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was able to return two days later.    
This time, he managed to climb into the mouth of Kituro    
so that he could take photographs and measure temperatures.    
Tazieff has often risked his life in this way.    
He has been able to tell us more about active volcanoes than any man alive.

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. has spent his lifetime studying ,把毕生的精力都用于研究。动词 spend 后面常加 in doing sth., 其中 in 可以省略。
2. in all parts of the world,这个介词短语用来修饰前面两个名词,意思是“世界各地的(活火山和深洞)”
3. a river of liquid rock,--股岩浆,这是一种修辞方法,被称为暗喻。
4. in time,及时地。
5. risked his life,冒着生命危险。

**参考译文**

波兰科学家哈罗恩.塔捷耶夫花了毕生的精力来研究世界各地的活火山和深洞。
1948年他去了刚果的基伍湖，对一座后来被他命名为基图罗的新火山进行观察。
当火山正在猛烈地喷发时，塔捷耶夫有办法把帐篷搭在离它非常近的地方。
尽管他设法拍了一些十分精彩的照片，但他却不能在火山附近停留太长的时间。
他发现有一股岩浆正向他流过来，眼看就要将他团团围住，但塔捷耶夫还是设法及时逃离了。
他等到火山平静下来，两天以后又返回去。
这次他设法爬进了基图罗火山口，以便能拍摄照片和测试温度。
塔捷耶夫经常冒这样的生命危险。
他能告诉我们的有关活火山的情况比任何在世的人都要多。       


## Lesson68 Persistent 纠缠不休
**Why did Elizabeth tell Nigel that she was going to the dentist?**

I crossed the street to avoid meeting him, but he saw me and came running towards me.    
It was no use pretending that I had not seen him, so I waved to him.   
I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykes. He never has anything to do.    
No matter how busy you are, he always insists on coming with you.    
I had to think of a way of preventing him from following me around all morning.   
'Hello, Nigel,' I said. 'Fancy meeting you here!'   
'Hi, Elizabeth,' Nigel answered. 'I was just wondering how to spend the morning    
-- until I saw you. You're not busy doing anything, are you?'   
'No, not at all,' I answered. 'I'm going to...'   
'Would you mind my coming with you?' he asked, before I had finished speaking.   
'Not at all,' I lied, 'but I'm going to the dentist.'   
'Then I'll come with you,' he answered. 'There's always plenty to read in the waiting room!   

**New words and expressions 生词和短语**

1. persistent(title)/pəˈsɪstənt/ adj.坚持的，固执的
2. avoid(1.1)/əˈvɔɪd/v.避开
3. insist(1.5)/ɪnˈsɪst/v.坚持做

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. to avoid meeting him,避免碰上他,这是动词后面用动名词作宾语的结构。本课下文中出现的 enjoy.fancy,mind,finish等动词,也是只接动名词作宾语的动词。
2. camr running towards me,向我跑来,running是现在分词,作状语,表示状况。
3. It was no use pretending,装作……是没有用了。在这句话中,it是先行词,实际上主语是动名词短pretending that I had not seen him 。
4. No matter how busy you are,不管你有多忙。这是一个让步状语从句,no matter 常与 how,when,where.wwhat,who 等引导的从句相连,可译成“无论”。
5. prevent sb.from doing sth,是“阻止某人做菜事”,介词fom 可以省略。
6. Fancy meeling you here! 想不到在这里见到你!fancy + -ing 表示对后面的 -ing 所表示的动作感到惊奇。
7. You're not busy doing anything,are you?你不忙，是吧?这是一个附加疑问句,也称反意疑问句。它是由陈述句加上简略疑问句构成的。如果陈述句是肯定的,那么问句用否定形式:反之，陈述句是否定的,疑问句用肯定形式
8. Would you mind my coming with you?我跟你一道去行吗?这是一个表示客气请求的结构，my是动名词coming的逻辑主语。
9. the waiting room,候诊室。

**参考译文**

杰里米·汉普登交际甚广，是各种聚会上深受大家欢迎的人。
我穿过马路以便避开他，但他看到我并朝我跑过来。
若再装作没看见他已是没有用了，我只好向他招手。
我就怕遇到奈杰尔.戴克斯。他从来都是无事可做，
不管你多忙，他总是坚持要跟你去。我得想办法不让他整个上午缠着我。
“你好，奈杰尔，想不到在这儿见到你。”我说。
“你好，伊丽莎白，”奈杰尔回答说，“我正不知道怎么消磨这一上午呢，
正好见到你。你不忙，是吗?”
“不，不忙，我打算去......”我回答。
“我跟你一道去行吗?”没等我说完话他就问道。
“没关系，但我准备去牙医那里。”我说了个谎。
“那我也跟你去，候诊室里总有很多东西可供阅读!”他回答。     


## Lesson69 But not murder! 并非谋杀！
**Do you think that the writer passed his driving test? Why?**

I was being tested for a driving licence for the third time.    
I had been asked to drive in heavy traffic and had done so successfully.    
After having been instructed to drive out of town,    
I began to acquire confidence. Sure that I had passed,    
I was almost beginning to enjoy my test.   
The examiner must have been pleased with my performance,    
for he smiled and said, 'Just one more thing, Mr. Eames.   
Let us suppose that a child suddenly crosses the road in front of you.    
As soon as I tap on the window, you must stop within five feet.’    
I continued driving and after some time, the examiner tapped loudly.    
Though the sound could be heard clearly. it took me a long time to react.    
I suddenly pressed the brake pedal hard and we were both thrown forward.    
The examiner looked at me sadly. 'Mr, Eames,’ he said, in a mournful voice, "you have just killed that child!

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. driving licence,驾驶执照。
2. After having been instructed to drive out of town,在接到把车开出城的指令后。介词 after 后面接动名词完成式的被动结构,整个介词短语作时间状语,相当于一个时间状语从句After I had been instructed to …
3. Sure that I had passed,确信我已通过考试,sure 的前面省略了 Being。
4. The examiner must have been pleased,主考人对我的驾驶想必是满意的。这里用must + have + 过去分词来对过去的事情表示推测。
5. in a mournful voice,用悲伤的声调。

**参考译文**

我第3次接受驾驶执照考试。按照要求在车辆拥挤的路上驾驶,我圆满地完成了。
在接到把车开出城的指令后,我开始有了信心。
确信我已通过考试,所以我几乎开始喜欢起这次考试 。
主考人对我的驾驶想必是满意的因为他微笑着说:“埃姆斯先生,只剩1项了。
让我们假设一个小孩子突然在你前面穿过马路。
我一敲车窗,你必须把车停在5英尺之内。”我继续往前开着。
过了一会儿,主考人砰砰地敲了起来。虽然"音听得很清楚,但我过了好一会儿才作出反应。
我突然用力踩紧刹车踏板,结果我俩的身体都向前冲去。主考人伤心地看着我。
“埃姆斯先生”他以悲伤的声调说，“你刚刚把那个小孩压死了!"   


## Lesson70 Red for danger 危险的红色
**How was the drunk removed from the ring?**

During a bullfight, a drunk suddenly wandered into the middle of the ring.    
The crowd began to shout, but the drunk was unaware of the danger.   
The bull was busy with the matador at the time,    
but it suddenly caught sight of the drunk who was shouting rude remarks and waving a red cap.    
Apparently sensitive to criticism,    
the bull forgot all about the matador and charged at the drunk.    
The crowd suddenly grew quiet. The drunk, however, seemed quite sure of himself.   
When the bull got close to him, he clumsily stepped aside to let it pass.   
The crowd broke into cheers and the drunk bowed.    
By this time, however, three men had come into the ring and they quickly dragged the drunk to safety.    
Even the bull seemed to feel sorry for him,    
for it looked on sympathetically until the drunk was out of the way before once more turning its attention to the matador.

**参考译文**

在一次斗牛时，一个醉汉突然溜达到斗牛场中间，
人们开始大叫起来，但醉汉却没有意识到危险。
当时那公牛正忙于对付斗牛士，但突然它看见了醉汉，
只见他正大声说着粗鲁的话，手里挥动着一顶红帽子。
对挑衅显然非常敏感的公牛完全撇开斗牛士，直奔醉汉而来。
观众突然静了下来，可这醉汉像是很有把握似的。
当公牛逼近他时，他踉跄地住旁边一闪，牛扑空了。
观众欢呼起来，醉汉向人们鞠躬致谢。
然而，此时已有3个人进入斗牛场，迅速把醉汉拉到安全的地方。
好像连牛也在为他感到遗憾，因为它一直同情地看着醉汉，
直到他的背影消逝，才重新将注意力转向斗牛士。
