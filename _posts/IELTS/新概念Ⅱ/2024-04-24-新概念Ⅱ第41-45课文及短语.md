## Lesson41 Do you call that a hat?你把那个叫帽子吗？
**What kind of shopping does the writer enjoy, do you think?**

‘Do you call that a hat?’I said to my wife.   
‘You needn't be so rude about it,’my wife answered as she looked at herself in the mirror.   
I sat down on one of those modern chairs with holes in it and waited.    
We had been in the hat shop for half an hour and my wife was still in front of the mirror.   
‘We mustn't buy things we don't need,’I remarked suddenly. I regretted saying it almost at once.   
‘You needn't have said that,’my wife answered. ‘I needn't remind you of that terrible tie you bought yesterday.’   
‘I find it beautiful, ’I said. ‘A man can never have too many ties.’   
‘And a woman can't have too many hats，’she answered.   
Ten minutes later we walked out of the shop together. My wife was wearing a hat that looked like a lighthouse!     

**New words and expressions 生词和短语**  

1. rude (1.2) /ru:d/adj. 无礼的
2. remark (1.7)/ri'ma:k/v. 评说
3. mirror (1.3) /'mirə/n. 镜子
4. remind (1.9) /ri'maind/v. 提醒
5. hole (1.4) /həul/n. 孔
6. lighthouse (1.14)/'laithaus/n. 灯塔

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. … needn't be so rude…英语中实际上有两个 need。一个是普通动词 need；另一个是情态动词 need。情态动词的 need和can，may等情态动词一样，后接动词原形，但只用于否定和疑问句，肯定句用must，have to，ought to或 should。
2. I regretted saying…，regret后接动名词表示对做过的事感到遗憾。
3. We mustn't buy things we don't need．我们不应该买我们不需要的东西。句中的 need 是普通动词，当“需要”讲。
4. You needn't have said that…needn't have done 表示本来用不着做某事，而实际上已经做了。
5. I needn't remind you of that terrible tie you bought yesterday．我也不必提醒你昨天买的那条糟糕透了的领带。remind sb．of sth．是“提醒某人想起某事”的意思。
6. I find it beautiful，我觉得它好看。句中的 beautiful用来补充说明宾语 it，在语法上称作宾语补足语。
7. A man can never have too many ties．男人有多少领带也不会嫌多。

**参考译文**

“你把那个叫帽子吗？”我对妻子说。
“你说话没必要这样不客气，”我的妻子边回答边照着镜子。
我坐在一个新式的满是网眼儿的椅子上，等待着。我们在这家帽店已经呆了半个小时了，而我的妻子仍在镜子面前。
“我们不应该买我们不需要的东西，”我突然发表意见说，但马上又后悔说了这话。
“你没必要这么说，”我妻子回答说，“我也不必提醒你昨天买的那条糟糕透了的领带。”
“我觉得它好看，”我说，“男人有多少领带也不会嫌多。”
“女人有多少帽子也不嫌多。”她回答。
10分钟以后，我们一道走出了商店。我妻子戴着一顶像灯塔一样的帽子。    


## Lesson42 Not very musical 并非很懂音乐
**What happened when the snake charmer began to play jazz?**

As we had had a long walk through one of the markets of Old Delhi,   
we stopped at a square to have a rest.    
After a time, we noticed a snake charmer with two large baskets at the other side of the square,   
so we went to have a look at him, As soon as he saw us,   
he picked up a long pipe which was covered with coins and opened one of the baskets,    
When he began to play a tune, we had our first glimpse of the snake.    
It rose out of the basket and began to follow the movements of the pipe.    
We were very much surprised when the snake charmer suddenly began to play jazz and modern pop songs.    
The snake, however, continued to 'dance' slowly.   
It obviously could not tell the difference between Indian music and jazz!

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. Not very musical 是指蛇并不那样“懂”音乐。
2. It obviously could not tell the difierence between Indian music and jazz! 显然,它分辨不出印度音乐和爵士乐! tell the difiercnce between…, 辨别……之间的不同。

**参考译文**

当我们穿过旧德里的市场时走了很长一段路,
我们在一个广场上停下来休息。
过了一会儿,我们注意到广场的那一边有一个带着两个大筐的要蛇人,
于是就走过去看看。
他一见我们,就拿起了一个长长的上面镶有硬币的管乐器,
并掀开了一个筐的盖子。
当他开始吹奏一支曲子时,我们才第一次看到那条蛇。
它从筐里探出身子,随着乐器的摆动而扭动,
当要蛇人突然又吹奏起爵士乐和现代流行乐曲时,我们感到非常惊奇。
然而那蛇却还是缓慢地“舞动”着。
显然,它分辨不出印度音乐和爵士乐!   


## Lesson43 Over the South Pole 飞越南极
**How was the plane able to clear the mountains?**

In 1929, three years after his flight over the North Pole,    
the American explorer, R.E. Byrd, successfully flew over the South Pole for the first time.   
Though, at first, Byrd and his men were able to take a great many photographs of the mountains    
that lay below, they soon ran into serious trouble.    
At one point, it seemed certain that their plane would crash.    
It could only get over the mountains if it rose to 10,000  feet.    
Byrd at once ordered his men to throw out two heavy food sacks.    
The plane was then able to rise and it cleared the mountains by 400  feet.    
Byrd now knew that he would be able to reach the South Pole which was 300 miles away,    
for there were no more mountains in sight.    
The aircraft was able to fly over the endless white plains without difficulty.

美国探险家R·E·伯德在飞越北极3年之后，
于1929年第一次飞越了南极。
虽然开始时伯德和他的助手们拍下了飞机下面连绵群山的大量照片，
但他们很快就陷入了困境。
在有个地方，飞机似乎肯定要坠毁了。
只有在飞至10，000英尺的高度时，它才能飞过这些山头。
伯德马上命令他的助手们把两个沉重的食物袋扔掉，
于是飞机可以上升了，它在离山头400英尺的高度飞越了过去。
伯德这时知道他能够顺利飞抵300英里以外的南极了，
因为前面再没有山了。
飞机可以毫无困难地飞过这片茫茫无际的白色原野！


## Lesson44 Through the forest 穿过森林
**How did Mrs.Sterling get her bag back?**

Mrs. Anne Sterling did not think of the risk she was taking    
when she ran through a forest after two men.    
They had rushed up to her while she was having a picnic at the edge    
of a forest with her children and tried to steal her handbag.    
In the struggle, the strap broke and, with the bag in their possession,    
both men started running through the trees.   
Mrs.Sterling got so angry that she ran after them.    
She was soon out of breath, but she continued to run.    
When she caught up with them,    
she saw that they had sat down and were going through the contents of the bag,    
so she ran straight at them.    
The men got such a fright that they dropped the bag and ran away.

## Lesson45 A clear conscience 问心无愧
**How did Sam get his money back?**

The whole village soon learnt that a large sum of money had been lost.    
Sam Benton, the local butcher,    
had lost his wallet while taking his savings to the post office.    
Sam was sure that the wallet must have been found by one of the villagers,   
but it was not returned to him.    
Three months passed, and then one morning,    
Sam found his wallet outside his front door.    
It had been wrapped up in newspaper and it contained half the money he had lost,   
together with a note which said:‘A thief, yes, but only 50  per cent a thief!’   
Two months later, some more money was sent to Sam with another note:‘Only 25  per cent a thief now!’   
In time, all Sam's  money was paid back in this way. The last note said:‘I am 100  per cent honest now!’

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. Sam Benton, the local butcher, had lost his wallet while taking his savings to the post office.当地的屠户萨姆·本顿在把存款送往邮局的途中把钱包丢了。其中的 while taking his savings是现在分词用于连词之后，与表示时间的状语从句 while he was taking his savings作用是一致的。
2. the wallet must have been found by one of the villagers, 钱包肯定是被某个村民捡到了。 must在这里表示推测，由于是对过去的推测，因此must之后的动词要用完成形式。
3. in time, 最后，终于。

**参考译文**

整个村子很快知道，有一大笔钱丢失了。
当地的屠户萨姆·本顿在把存款送往邮局的途中把钱包丢了。
萨姆确信那钱包一定是被某个村民捡到了，
可是却不见有人来送还给他。
3个月过去了，后来在一天早晨，萨姆在自己的大门外发现了他的钱包。
钱包是用报纸包着的，里面有他丢失的钱的一半，
而且还附着一张纸条，上面写着：“一个小偷，是的，但只是一个50％的小偷！”
又过了两个月，又有一些钱送还给了萨姆，又附了一张字条：“这回只是 25％的小偷了！”
很快，萨姆全部的钱都用同样的方式还了回来。
最后的那张字条上写道：“我现在是一个100％的诚实人了！”
