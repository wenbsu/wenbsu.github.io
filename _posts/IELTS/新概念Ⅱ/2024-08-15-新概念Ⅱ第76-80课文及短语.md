## Lesson76 April Fools' Day 愚人节
**What was the joke?**

'To end our special news bulletin,' said the voice of the television
announcer, 'we're going over to the macaroni fields of Calabria.
Macaroni has been grown in this area for over six hundred years.
Two of the leading growers, Giuseppe Moldova and Riccardo
Brabante, tell me that they have been expecting a splendid crop
this year and harvesting has begun earlier than usual. Here you can
see two workers who, between them, have just finished cutting three
cartloads of golden brown macaroni stalks. The whole village has
been working day and night gathering and threshing this year's crop before the September rains. On the
right, you can see Mrs. Brabante herself. She has been helping her husband for thirty years now. Mrs.
Brabante is talking to the manager of the local factory where the crop is processed. This last scene shows
you what will happen at the end of the harvest: the famous Calabrian macaroni-eating competition!
Signor Fratelli, the present champion, has won it every year since 1991. And that ends our special bulletin
for today, Thursday, April 1st. We're now going back to the studio.'

## Lesson77 A successful operation 一例成功的手术
**Did the doctors find out how the woman died?**

The mummy of an Egyptian woman who died in 800 B.C. has just
had an operation. The mummy is that of Shepenmut who was once
a singer in the Temple of Thebes. As there were strange marks on
the X-ray plates taken of the mummy, doctors have been trying to
find out whether the woman died of a rare disease. The only way to
do this was to operate. The operation, which lasted for over four
hours, proved to be very difficult because of the hard resin which
covered the skin. The doctors removed a section of the mummy and
sent it to a laboratory. They also found something which the X-ray plates did not show: a small wax figure of
the god Duamutet. This god which has the head of a cow was normally placed inside a mummy. The doctors
have not yet decided how the woman died. They feared that the mummy would fall to pieces when they cut it
open, but fortunately this has not happened. The mummy successfully survived the operation.

死于公元前800年的一位埃及妇女的木乃伊刚刚接受了一次手术。这是曾在底比斯神殿里当过歌手的舍彭穆特的木乃伊。由于在给这个木乃伊拍摄的X光片子上有奇怪的斑点，所以，医生们一直试图搞清楚这位妇女是否死于一种罕见的疾病。为此唯一的办法就是动手术。手术持续了4个多小时，非常难做，因为木乃伊上覆盖着坚硬的树脂。医生们从木乃伊身上取下一个切片，送到实验室化验。他们还发现了X光片子上没有显示出来的东西：一个蜡制的杜阿穆特特神像。这个长着牛头的神像通常被放在木乃伊里面。医生们至今还未确定这位妇女的死因。他们原先担心在切开木乃伊时它会散掉，但幸运的是这种情况并没有发生。这具木乃伊成功地经受住了手术。

## Lesson78 The last one? 最后一支吗？
**For how long did the writer give up smoking?**

After reading an article entitled 'Cigarette Smoking and Your Health'
I lit a cigarette to calm my nerves. I smoked with concentration and
pleasure as I was sure that this would be my last cigarette. For a
whole week I did not smoke at all and during this time, my wife
suffered terribly. I had all the usual symptoms of someone giving
up smoking: a bad temper and an enormous appetite. My friends
kept on offering me cigarettes and cigars. They made no effort to
hide their amusement whenever I produced a packet of sweets from
my pocket. After seven days of this I went to a party. Everybody around me was smoking and I felt extremely
uncomfortable. When my old friend Brian urged me to accept a cigarette, it was more than I could bear. I took
one guiltily, lit it and smoked with satisfaction. My wife was delighted that things had returned to normal
once more. Anyway, as Brian pointed out, it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking. He himself
has done it lots of times!

## Lesson79 By air 乘飞机
**Why did the plane turn back?**

I used to travel by air a great deal when I was a boy. My parents
used to live in South America and I used to fly there from Europe
in the holidays. A flight attendant would take charge of me and I
never had an unpleasant experience. I am used to travelling by air
and only on one occasion have I ever felt frightened. After taking
off, we were flying low over the city and slowly gaining height,
when the plane suddenly turned round and flew back to the airport.
While we were waiting to land, a flight attendant told us to keep
calm and to get off the plane quietly as soon as it had touched down. Everybody on board was worried and
we were curious to find out what had happened. Later we learnt that there was a very important person on
board. The police had been told that a bomb had been planted on the plane. After we had landed, the plane
was searched thoroughly. Fortunately, nothing was found and five hours later we were able to take off again.

6. touch down, (飞机)着陆。

**参考译文**

我在幼年的时候，曾多次乘飞机旅行。我的父母曾经住在南美洲，所以假期里我常从欧洲乘飞机到他们那里。我总是由一位空中乘务员照管，从未遇到过不愉快的经历。我习惯了乘飞机旅行，只是有一次把我吓坏了。起飞之后，我们在城市上空低低地飞行，慢慢爬升，这时飞机突然调转头来，飞回了机场。在我们等待着陆时，一位空中乘务员让我们保持镇静，飞机一着陆就让我们悄悄下飞机。机上的人都很着急，我们都急于想知道究竟出了什么事。后来我们得知机上有一位很重要的人物。警方获悉飞机上安放了一枚炸弹。我们降落之后，对飞机进行了彻底搜查。幸运的是，什么也没有找到，5个小时后我们又起飞了。

## Lesson80 The Crystal Palace 水晶宫
**How many people visited the Great Exhibition of 1851?**

Perhaps the most extraordinary building of the nineteenth century was the Crystal Palace, which was built in Hyde Park for the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Crystal Palace was different from all other buildings in the world, for it was made of iron and glass. It was one of the biggest buildings of all time and a lot of people from many countries came to see it. A great many goods were sent to the exhibition from various parts of the world. There was also a great deal of machinery on display. The most wonderful piece of machinery on show was Nasmyth's steam hammer. Though in those days, travelling was not as easy as it is today, steam boats carried thousands of visitors across the Channel from Europe. On arriving in England, they were taken to the Crystal Palace by train. There were six million visitors in all, and the profits from the exhibition were used to build museums and colleges. Later, the Crystal Palace was moved to South London. It remained one of the most famous buildings in the world until it was burnt down in 1936.

**参考译文**

19世纪最不寻常的建筑也许要数水晶宫了，它是为1851年的"世界博览会"而建在海德公园的。这座水晶宫不同于世界上所有其他建筑，因为它是用钢和玻璃建成的。它是有史以来最大的建筑物之一，许多国家的人们都来参观。大量物品从世界各地运来参展。还展出了大量机器。展出的最精彩的机器是内史密斯的蒸汽锤。虽然在那个年代旅行不像今天这样容易，但蒸汽轮船还是载运了成千上万的参观者从欧洲大陆横渡英吉利海峡。他们到达英国后，乘火车被送往水晶宫。参观者总计达600万人，展览会的收入被用来建造博物馆和学院。后来，水晶宫被移到了伦敦南部。它一直是世界上最著名的建筑物之一，直到1936年被焚毁为止。
