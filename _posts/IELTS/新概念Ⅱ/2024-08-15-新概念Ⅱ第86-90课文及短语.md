## Lesson86 Out of control 失控
**Why did the man on the motorboat wave to the writer?**

The moment I stepped into the water,    
I knew that something was wrong.    
The water was much colder than I had expected    
and I was soon in trouble.    
I had never been a good swimmer,    
but now I was in real danger.    
I tried to keep my head above water,    
but the waves were too strong for me.    
I was being swept out to sea.    
I shouted for help,    
but no one heard me.    
I was beginning to lose hope    
when I saw a motorboat in the distance.    
I waved my arms wildly    
and the man in the boat saw me.    
He turned the boat round    
and came towards me.    
I was saved!    
The man in the boat was a complete stranger to me,    
but he had risked his life to save mine.    
I thanked him again and again,    
but he just smiled and said,    
'That's all right.    
I'm glad I was able to help.'

我得救了！

但他冒着生命危险来救我。

## Lesson87 A perfect alibi 极好的不在犯罪现场的证据
**Why was the inspector suspicious?**

'At the time the murder was committed,    
I was travelling on the 8.00 o'clock train to London,'    
said the man.    
'Do you always catch such an early train?'    
asked the inspector.    
'Of course I do,'    
answered the man.    
'I must be at work at 10.00 o'clock.    
My employer will confirm that I was there on time.'    
'Would a later train get you to work on time?'    
asked the inspector.    
'I suppose it would,    
but I never catch a later train.'    
'At what time did you arrive at the station?'    
'At ten to eight.    
I bought a paper and waited for the train.'    
'And you didn't notice anything unusual?'    
'Of course not.'    
'I think,'    
said the inspector,    
'that you are lying.    
This morning, the 8.00 o'clock train did not run at all.    
It broke down at Ferngreen station and was taken off the line.'

## Lesson88 Trapped in a mine 困在矿井里
**Why is the rescue taking so long?**

Six men have been trapped in a mine for seventeen hours.    
If they are not brought to the surface soon,    
they may lose their lives.    
However, rescue operations are proving difficult.    
If explosives are used,    
vibrations will cause the roof of the mine to collapse.    
Rescue workers are therefore drilling a hole on the north side of the mine.    
They intend to bring the men up through this hole.    
A microphone has been lowered into the mine    
and the men have been able to speak to their relatives.    
They are running short of food and drink.    
They have been told that rescue operations are progressing smoothly.    
If they knew how difficult it was to drill through the hard rock,    
they would lose heart.

6个人被困在矿井里已有17个小时了。
如果他们不能很快被带到地面，
他们可能会丧生。
然而，营救工作证明是很困难的。
如果使用炸药，
震动会引起矿井顶部坍塌。
因此，营救人员在矿井北侧钻了一个洞。
他们打算通过这个洞把人救上来。
一个麦克风被放到了矿井里，
这样人们就可以和他们的亲属通话了。
他们的食物和饮料快用完了。
他们被告知营救工作进行得很顺利。
如果他们知道在坚硬的岩石上钻孔是多么困难的话，
他们会失去信心的。

## Lesson89 A slip of the tongue 口误
**What made the audience very amused?**

People will do anything to see a free show --    
even if it is a bad one.    
When the news got round that a comedy show would be presented at our local cinema    
by the P. and U. Bird Seed Company,    
we all rushed to see it.    
We had to queue for hours to get in    
and there must have been several hundred people present just before the show began.    
Unfortunately, the show was one of the dullest we have ever seen.    
Those who failed to get in need not have felt disappointed,    
as many of the artists who should have appeared did not come.    
The only funny things we heard that evening came from the advertiser at the beginning of the programme.    
He was obviously very nervous and for some minutes stood awkwardly before the microphone.    
As soon as he opened his mouth,    
everyone burst out laughing.    
We all know what the poor man should have said,    
but what he actually said was:    
'This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company.    
Good ladies, evening and gentlemen!'

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. get round,传开。
2. need not have done,本不必。
3. burst out laughing,突然大笑起来。

**参考译文**

人们总是不惜任何代价去看免费的演出
-- 哪怕是拙劣的演出。
当"皮尤"鸟食公司将在我们当地影院演出喜剧节目的消息传开后，
我们都赶紧跑去观看。
我们不得不排了好几个小时才进得场去。
在演出开始前场内肯定已有好几百人了。
不幸的是，这次演出是我们看过的最乏味的演出了。
那些没能进到场内的人没有必要感到失望，
因为很多应该出场的专业演员都没有来。
那天晚上唯一有趣的事情是节目开始时那个报幕员的开场白。
他显然非常紧张，局促不安地在麦克风前站了好几分钟。
他一开口说话，
人们便哄堂大笑起来。
我们都知道那个可怜的人应该说些什么，
而他实际说的却是：
"这是'皮尤'和'伊'鸟食公司。
好女士们，晚上和先生们！"

## Lesson90 What's for supper? 晚餐吃什么？
**Why did the writer's wife suggest having fish and chips?**

Fish and chips has always been a favourite dish in Britain,    
but as the oceans have been overfished,    
fish has become more and more expensive.    
So it comes as a surprise to learn that giant fish are terrifying the divers on North Sea oil rigs.    
Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently and divers,    
who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water,    
have been frightened out of their wits by giant fish bumping into them as they work.    
Now they have had special cages made to protect them from these monsters.    
The fish are not sharks or killer whales,    
but favourite eating varieties like cod and skate    
which grow to unnatural sizes,    
sometimes as much as twelve feet in length.    
Three factors have caused these fish to grow so large:    
the warm water round hot oil pipes under the sea;    
the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on the rigs;    
and the total absence of fishing boats around the oil rigs.    
As a result,    
the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water.    
Who eats who?

3. giant(1.3)/ˈdʒaɪənt/adj.巨大的
4. terrify(1.3)/ˈterɪfaɪ/v.吓，使恐怖
5. diver(1.3)/ˈdaɪvə(r)/n.潜水员
6. oil rig(1.3)/ɔɪl rɪɡ/n.石油钻塔
7. wit(1.5)/wɪt/n.理智，头脑
8. cage(1.6)/keɪdʒ/n.笼子
9. shark(1.7)/ʃɑːk/n.鲨鱼
10. whale(1.7)/weɪl/n.鲸
11. variety(1.8)/vəˈraɪəti/n.品种
12. cod(1.8)/kɒd/n.鳕鱼
13. skate(1.8)/skeɪt/n.鳐

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

2. bump into,撞上。
3. protect from,保护。
4. as a result,结果。

**参考译文**

油煎鱼加炸土豆片一直是英国人喜爱的一道菜，
但是随着海洋里的滥捕滥捞，
鱼已经变得越来越昂贵。
因此，当听说北海石油钻井平台上的潜水员受到巨型鱼类的恐吓时，确实很让人吃惊。
石油钻井平台需要经常修理，潜水员常常要在水面100英尺以下摸黑工作，
他们曾在工作时被撞到他们身上的巨型鱼类吓得不知所措。
现在他们有了特制的笼子，用来保护他们免受这些庞然大物的伤害。
这些鱼并不是鲨鱼或逆戟鲸，
而是深受人们喜爱的食用鱼品种，如鳕鱼和鳐鱼，
只不过它们长得出奇地大，有时长达12英尺。
这些鱼能长得这么大是由3个因素造成的：
海底输油管道附近的温暖的海水；
钻井平台工作人员抛到海里充足的食物；
钻井平台周围完全没有捕鱼船只。
结果是，
这些鱼就在可爱的温暖的水流中吃啊吃，长啊长。
究竟谁吃谁呢？
