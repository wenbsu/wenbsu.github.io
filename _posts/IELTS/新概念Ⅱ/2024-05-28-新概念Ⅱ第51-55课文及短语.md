## Lesson51 Reward for virtue 对美德的奖赏
**Why did Hugh's diet not work?**

My friend, Hugh, has always been fat,    
but things got so bad recentlythat he decided to go on a diet.    
He began his diet a week ago.    
First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.   
The list included most of the things Hugh loves:    
butter, potatoes,rice, beer, milk, chocolate, and sweets.    
Yesterday I paid him a visit.   
I rang the bell and was not surprised to see that Hugh was still as fat as ever.    
He led me into his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.    
It was obvious that he was very embarrassed.    
When I asked him what he was doing,    
he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.    
He explained that his diet was so strict that he had to reward himself occasionally.    
Then he showed me the contents of the parcel.    
It contained five large bars of chocolate and three bags of sweets!

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1. Reward for virtue, virtue作“美德”讲，此处指“节食”一事。
2. but things got so bad,但是情况变得如此糟糕。动词get作“变得”，“成为”讲。
3. go on a diet(=be on a diet),实行节食。
4. first of all, 首先。
5. I paid him a visit. 我去拜访他。
6. as fat as ever, 像以往一样胖，其中的as ever实际上是状语从句as he ever was 的省略形式。
7. It was obvious that he was very embarrassed. 显然他感到很尴尬。that引导的从句是一个名词性从句，在句子中作主语，it是先行主语。

**参考译文**

我的朋友休一直很胖，
但是近来情况变得越发糟糕，
以致他决定节食。
他是一星期前开始节食的。
首先，他开列了一张长长的单子，
上面列了所有禁吃的食物。
这张单子上的大多数食物都是休喜欢吃的：
黄油、土豆、米饭、啤酒、牛奶、巧克力和糖果。
昨天我去看望了他。
我按响了门铃。
当看到休仍和往常一样胖时，我并不感到惊奇。
他把我领进屋，慌忙把一个大包藏到了桌子下面。
显然他感到很尴尬。
当我问他正干什么时，他内疚地笑了，
然后把那个大包拿到了桌上。
他解释说，他的饮食控制得太严格了，
以致不得不偶尔奖赏自己一下。
接着他给我看了包里的东西。
里面装了5大块巧克力和3袋糖果！  


## Lesson52 A pretty carpet 漂亮的地毯
**What is the writer's carpet made of?**

We have just moved into a new house and I have been working hard all morning.   
I have been trying to get my new room in order.    
This has not been easy because I own over a thousand books.   
To make matters worse, the room is rather small,    
so I have temporarily put my books on the floor.    
At the moment, they cover every inch of floor space    
and I actually have to walk on them to get in or out of the room.    
A short while ago, my sister helped me to carry one of my old bookcases up the stairs.   
She went into my room and got a big surprise    
when she saw all those books on the floor.   
‘This is the prettiest carpet I have ever seen,’she said.    
She gazed at it for some time then added,   
‘You don't need bookcases at all.    
You can sit here in your spare time and read the carpet!’

**参考译文**

我们刚刚搬进一所新房子， 我辛辛苦苦地干了整整一个上午。
我试图把我的新房间收拾整齐，但这并不容易， 因为我有1,000多本书。
更糟糕的是房间还非常小，所以我暂时把书放在了地板上。
这会儿，书把地板的每一点空隙都占据了，
我实际上是踩着这些书进出房间的。
几分钟前，我妹妹帮我把一个旧书橱抬上了楼。
她走进我的房间，当她看到地板上的那些书时，大吃一惊。
“这是我见过的最漂亮的地毯，”她说。
她盯着“地毯”看了一会儿，又说：
“你根本用不着书橱，空闲时你可以坐在这儿读地毯！”   


## Lesson53 Hot snake 触电的蛇
**What caused the fire?**

At last firemen have put out a big forest fire in California.    
Since then, they have been trying to find out how the fire began.   
Forest fires are often caused by broken glass    
or by cigarette ends which people carelessly throw away.   
Yesterday the firemen examined the ground carefully,    
but were not able to find any broken glass.   
They were also quite sure that a cigarette end did not start the fire.    
This morning, however, a firemen accidentally discovered the cause.   
He noticed the remains of a snake which was wound round    
the electric wires of a 16，000-volt power line.    
In this way, he was able to solve the mystery.   
The explanation was simple but very unusual.    
A bird had snatched up the snake from the ground    
and then dropped it on to the wires.    
The snake then wound itself round the wires.    
When it did so, it sent sparks down to the ground    
and these immediately started a fire.

**参考译文**

消防队员们终于扑灭了加利福尼亚的一场森林大火。
从那时起，他们一直试图找出起火的原因。
森林火灾时常由破碎的玻璃或人们随手扔掉的香烟头引起。
昨天，消防队员仔细查看了地面，但未能发现碎玻璃。
他们还十分肯定火灾也不是由烟头引起的。
然而今天上午，一个消防队员偶然发现了起火的原因。
他发现了缠绕在16，000伏高压线上的一条死蛇。
就这样，他解开了起火之谜。
解释很简单，却异乎寻常。
一只鸟把蛇从地上抓起来，然后把它扔到了电线上。
于是蛇就缠住了几根电线。
当它这样做时，把火花送到了地面，
这些火花立刻引起了一场大火。

and then I went to the shops.   
It was still early when I returned home.    
The children were at school,    
my husband was at work and the house was quiet.    
So I decided to make some meat pies.   
In a short time I was busy mixing butter    
and flour and my hands were soon covered with sticky pastry.    
At exactly that moment, the telephone rang.    
Nothing could have been more annoying.    
I picked up the receiver between two sticky fingers    
and was dismayed when I recognized the voice of Helen Bates.    
It took me ten minutes to persuade her to ring back later.    
At last I hung up the receiver.   
What a mess! There was pastry on my fingers, on the telephone, and on the doorknobs.

## Lesson55 Not a gold mine 并非金矿
**What did the team find?**

Dreams of finding lost treasure almost came true recently.    
A new machine called‘The Revealer’has been invented    
and it has been used to detect gold which has been buried in the ground.   
The machine was used in a cave near the seashore    
where----it is said----pirates used to hide gold.    
The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it.    
Armed with the new machine,    
a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure.    
The leader of the party was examining the soil near the entrance to the cave    
when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground.    
Very excited, the party dug a hole two feet deep.    
They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless.   
The party then searched the whole cave thoroughly    
but did not find anything except an empty tin trunk.    
In spite of this, many people are confident    
that‘The Revealer’may reveal something of value fairly soon.

**参考译文**

最近，找到失踪宝藏的梦想差一点儿变成现实。
一种叫“探宝器”的新机器已经发明出来，
并被人们用来探测地下埋藏的金子。
在靠近海边的一个据说过去海盗常在里面藏金子的岩洞里，
这种机器被派上了用场。
海盗们过去常把金子埋藏在那个洞里，可后来却没能取走。
一支用这种新机器装备起来的探宝队进入了这个岩洞，希望找到埋藏着的金子。
当这个队的队长正在检查洞口附近的土壤时，那台机器显示出它的下面埋有金子。
队员们异常激动，就地挖了一个两英尺深的坑，
但最后找到的是一枚几乎一钱不值的小金币。
队员们接着又把整个洞彻底搜寻了一遍，
但除了一只空铁皮箱外什么也没找到。
尽管如此，很多人仍然相信“探宝器”很快就会探出值钱的东西来。
