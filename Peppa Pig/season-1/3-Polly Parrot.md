Peppa and her family are visiting Granny Pig and Grandpa  
Pig.  
Granny Pig! Grandpa Pig! Ganggy Ig! Baba Ig!  
Hello, my little ones. Come inside,  
We have a surprise.  
What is it?  
We have a new pet.  
Can you guess What it is?  
Dine-saw?  
No, it's not a dinosaur. Come and see.  
Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig have a pet parrot.  
Peppa, George, this is our pet parrot.  
She's called Polly.  
Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly. Oooh. WoW.  
I'm a clever parrot. I'm a clever parrot.  
Mummy, Why does Polly copy everything that Granny  
says?  
That's what parrots do. I'll show you.  
Hello, Polly. Hello, Polly.  
What a sweet little parrot! What a sweet little parrot!  
Come on, everyone, tea time!  
Peppa, George. Come on!  
There's chocolate cake!  
Coming, Granny!  
Peppa and George love eating chocolate cake.  
But today, they are in a hurry to get back and play with  
Polly Parrot.  
Finished!  
What noisy little ones you are!  
Granny, please, can we leave the table and go and see  
Polly Parrot?  
Are sure you've completely finished your cake?  
Off you go, then.  
Hurray!  
George, say something to Polly.  
George is a little bit shy.  
Hello. Hello.  
Peppa and George are really enjoying playing with Polly  
Parrot.  
I'm Peppa Pig!  
I'm Peppa Pig!  
George, say something. Peppa and George are pretending  
to be parrots.  
I'm Polly Parrot,  
Peppa is thinking of something else to say to Polly Parrot.  
I'm a noisy parrot! I'm a noisy parrot!  
Peppa, George, have you been playing with Polly?  
Yes, Granny. Polly is such a sweet parrot.  
Yes, Granny.  
I'm a clever parrot. I'm a noisy parrot! I'm a noisy parrot!  
Ohh! Oh, my word!  
I'm Peppa Pig. This is my little brother, George.
