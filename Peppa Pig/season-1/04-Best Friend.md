Peppa is waiting for her best friend, Suzy Sheep.  
Hello, Suzy!  
Baaaa! Hello, Peppa.  
Suzy Sheep has come to play with Peppa.  
Peppa loves Suzy.  
Suzy loves Peppa.  
They are best friends.  
Peppa, why don't you and Suzy go and play in your bedroom?  
Yes, Mummy!  
George wants to play, too.  
Peppa and Suzy love playing in Peppa's bedroom.  
So does George.  
No, George.  
This game is just for big girls.  
Go and play with your own toys.  
Peppa and Suzy want to play on their own.  
I'm a tiny little fairy princess!  
I'm going to wave my magic Wand... and turn you into a frog!  
George doesn't like playing on his own.  
George wants to play, too.  
No, George!  
I'm playing with Suzy...  
You'll have to play somewhere else.  
George wants to play with Peppa.  
He feels a bit lonely.  
George, I need some help!!  
I'm making chocolate chip cookies!!  
Someone needs to lick out the bowl.  
George likes helping Mummy make cookies.  
But he likes playing with Peppa more.  
I want to be a nurse!  
I want to be a doctor.  
But who's gonna be the sick person?  
GEORGE!!!  
Peppa and Suzy love playing doctors and nurses.  
So does George.  
Peppa listens to George's chest.  
Now, George, take a big breath in... then cough.  
Mm, I think your heart's a bit loose...  
I'll put a plaster on it.  
Baa! Open wide, please.  
Suzy takes George's temperature.  
Oh, dear, you're very, very hot.  
I think you have to stay in bed for three years.  
Daddy Pig has come to find George.  
Oh, no! What's Wrong With George?  
Don't Worry, Daddy.  
It's only a game.  
George is our patient.  
Oh, I see.  
Can the patient have a visitor?  
Just for a little While.  
He might get tired.  
Cookies!!!  
Yes, they're for George.  
They're his medicine to make him feel better.  
Um, excuse me, doctor,  
Can you help me?  
I have a sore tummy.  
That tickles!  
I can hear it rumbling.  
I think you're hungry, Daddy.  
Then I think I need lots of cookies to make me better.  
And me!  
And me!  
And me! Baa  
I'm Peppa Pig.  
This is my littIe brother, George.
