Peppa and George are playing hide and seek.  
It is George's turn to hide.  
He must quickly find somewhere to hide before Peppa  
finishes counting!  
One... two... three...four... five... six... seven...  
George has found somewhere to hide,  
eight... just in time!  
nine... ten... Ready or not.  
Here I come!  
Peppa has to find where George is hiding.  
Found you!  
Peppa has found George.  
George, I could see you too easily.  
Now it is Peppa's turn to hide.  
One... erm... three.  
I'II help George to count.  
One... two... three...four... five...six... seven... eight...nine...  
ten!  
Okay, George, open your eyes!  
George has to find Where Peppa is hiding.  
Oh.  
Peppa isn't hiding under the table.  
George, have you thought of looking upstairs?  
Peppa isn't under the bed.  
What was that strange noise?  
Peppa isn't behind the curtain.  
There is that strange noise again!  
What can it be?  
Whee !  
George has found where  
Peppa was hiding.  
George found me!  
Now it's Daddy's turn to hide!  
Oh, I think George should have another turn.  
But George isn't very good at hiding...  
I'm sure he'll be better this time.  
Close your eyes and start counting.  
One... two...three... Oh, dear.  
Peppa will easily find George. four...five...six... George!  
Come over here... seven...eight... nine... ten!  
Ready or not, here I come!  
Oh, George isn't hiding under the table!  
But George always hides under the table!  
Have you thought of looking upstairs?  
I know where he is!  
George is in the toy basket.  
Oh.  
George is not in the toy basket!  
Where can he be?  
Peppa can not find George anywhere.  
Daddy? I can't find George anywhere.  
Oh, dear, I wonder where he can be.  
Actually, I think there's something about George in this  
newspaper...  
Whee...  
George! Found you!  
Oh, George!  
That was a good place to hide!  
George was hiding behind  
Daddy Pig's newspaper all the time!  
I'm Peppa Pig.  
This is my little brother, George.
